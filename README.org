* Hyperstitional Themes

Weird themes for Emacs.

** Why?
I happen to like certain colors more than others and figured I’d just skip the painful process of selecting different colors, and instead pick two colors I like and pick colors out of a certain number of stops between them.  Make a "dim" variant, a "dark" variant and a "light" variant and you have a color palette from just two colors!

** Is it legible?
/Mostly/.  It is completely legible to me, but I don’t mind weird / bad contrast ratios.

- Digitalsear :: I did tweak the two primary colors with the  [[https://www.myndex.com/APCA/][ACPA Contrast Calculator]] to get a half-satisfactory score on most of the color stops and between the different variants.

** Motivation?

- Digitalsear :: The theme I use the most is [[https://github.com/precompute/sculpture-themes][Sculpture-themes-dark]].  The light variant is undermaintained, because I know I’ll have to modify a lot of colors and will end up maintaining two very different versions of the same theme.  The dark version is what I really set out to make.  So, I decided to make a theme that’s primarily a light theme, but can be inverted to be a dark theme.

** Themes
*** Digitalsear
Digitalsear has two versions: *Digitalsear* and *Digitalsear Inverted*.

Digitalsear works between #0000FF and #FF4000.  The background is off-white and dim enough to be gentle (for a light theme).

From top to bottom:
- Background / Foreground
- "Light" variant
- "Dim" variant
- Base variant
- "Dark" variant

Because we only have 7 distinguishable colors, many faces utilize both ~:foreground~ and ~:background~ properties to ensure distinguishability.

Distinguishability was important, because I was going to invert the theme.

*Digitalsear Inverted* uses an inverted palette.  I’ve only duplicated the primary theme, inverted all the colors and changed the name.
